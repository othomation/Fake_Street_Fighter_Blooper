It's a little game (WIP, totally WIP) where I'll try to make physics relative to the opponent (there are two player, locally).

Examples : You'll run faster if you run onto your opponent, and you'll run slower if you're trying to escape from your opponent.

That's it.

You can change the controls in the commands.rb file.
